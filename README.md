# CAPSENSE

This repository consists of a python code that is used to detect the numbers from 1-9 that is drawn using the Infineon's CAPSENSE touch pad...It also detects the characters "X" and "Y" and I am planning to build a TIC-TAC-TOE game using this. 

I hope to get some fruitful results soon and if you find this interesting kindly upvote :)
